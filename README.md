# Tellos Hx2 hybrid monitoring and remoting
> This software aims to remotely monitor and operate Tellos Hx2 Hybrids.

Developed in Python this software uses the GPIO of the hybrids in conjunction with an arduino Mega to monitor which hybrids are used and also allows to disconnect the hybrids remotely (activity that was previously done in the cold room).

This software provides:
1. Monitoring status ON / OFF;
2. Sound alert when changing status;
3. Hang up call remotely;
4. Simple log with date and time of connections and disconnections;
5. Send a log to database via request.

## Software configuration

To use this software in your environment, change the following files:
- folder /audio: In this folder, there are the sounds that are reproduced in the status change. To generate the audio files [Click Here](https://ttsmp3.com/). 

- folder /images: In this folder, there are the images of the hybrids. To edit with your phone numbers, use Paint or your favorite editing software.

In my case, I use seven rack units, totaling 14 phone extensions. Adapt the code to your needs.
